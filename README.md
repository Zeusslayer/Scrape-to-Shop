# Scrape-to-Shop

I'm creating a web page scraping tool to convert products into data sheets for me to use it later as shopping lists.

This project only excepts **Coolblue** product urls.
You need to change the `base_url` to same formated url with desired product.

## How To Use
I am running this project with GitHub Codespaces but can be cloned and used on your local machine.

### Installation
After opening Codespaces you need to make some installation to be able to run the code.

You need to install two extensions.

`python` for running python code.

`excel viewer` for viewing created excel file inside Codespaces. This is optinal. You can also download xlsx file and see it on your local machine.

Run this on the terminal
```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

Now it is ready to use!
